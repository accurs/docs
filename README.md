# 👋 The official repository for Evict documentation

Over here, you can see the code for the live [documentation page](https://docs.evict.bot) which uses the [mintlify/starter](https://github.com/mintlify/starter) kit
to power and enhance it.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Requirements

[`Node.js 20.11.0`](https://nodejs.org/en): JavaScript runtime used to run Javascript code<br />
[`pnpm 8.14.3`](https://pnpm.io/): Fast, disk space efficient package manager

### Starting the docs locally

- You must install all the packages by running `pnpm i` (NOTE: this project uses global packages, which requires you to run `pnpm setup` if you have not done so yet.)
- Run `mintlify dev` to first setup the project, after first start up the docs will start up faster. (for more information, head over to [mintlify.com](https://mintlify.com/))
