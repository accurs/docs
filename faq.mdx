    <Accordion title="Why does my embed keep failing?" icon="question">
      Make sure you are spelling the parameters properly and formatting the parser correctly.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Why is the lock/lockdown command not working?" icon="question">
      The lock command disables the `send_messages` permission for **@everyone**, however users with a role that allows them to send messages in the channel can still send messages, in order to solve this, use `;lock role [role]`.

    <Accordion title="Why isn't the bot responding?" icon="question">
     The bot requires at least the `embed_links` permission in order to send the help menu. If the bot has all the required permissions and still not responding then check the status page on our [website](https://www.evict.bot/status/) or [discord server](https://discord.gg/evict).
